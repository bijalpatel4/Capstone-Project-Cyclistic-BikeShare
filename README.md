# Capstone-Project-Cyclistic-BikeShare
Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success This is my case study on Cyclistic Bikeshare analysis as part of Google capestone project
Scenario You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

1. Ask Phase
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

2.Prepare Phase
The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
It was organised by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation. There were some anomalies in the data.

3.Process Phase
After regularising and importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. Added two columns to all of the months:
ride_length calculated the total ride length for each trip using the start_at column which was: ending time minus starting time. 
day_of_week calculated the day of the week for each trip using the start_at column date. 

4. Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

5.Share Phase
Visualisations were created using Tableau. Published here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bijal.patel1244 sharelink and included in the powerpoint presentation

6. Act Phase
A powerpoint presentation was compiled CyclisticProject.pptx.
